# file-manipulation
Two small python scripts that manipulate files:one is an picture resizing and moving into a designated folder script,the other is a virus-ish script that overwrites the content of test - readable files and turnes them into useles .jpg files.Renaming them back can't change anything,they're content is lost.Just for learning and experimenting purposes.
